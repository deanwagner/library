This project was created for the [Library assignment](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript/courses/javascript/lessons/library) as part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com) curriculum. I met all the assignment objectives and then expanded on it with my own concepts to make it more functional and user-friendly.

### Assets Supplied

* None

### Objectives

1. Store books as objects in an array
2. Display books in a table or as cards
3. Create New Book form to add books

5. Button for each book to change read/unread status
